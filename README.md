Veto is a super-lightweight PHP framework to make building web applications easier.

### New Projects

If you want to create a new project with Veto, we suggest you use the [Skeleton Project](https://github.com/themainframe/veto-skeleton/) package, which includes a templating engine (Twig) and some sample code to get you going.


### Installing

You can install Veto using composer. To start a new Veto-based project, just run:

	php composer.phar create-project themainframe/veto .
